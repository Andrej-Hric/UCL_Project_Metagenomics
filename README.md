# UCL Project Metagenomics
</div>

Undergraduate research project in metagenomics

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project was completed during my undergraduate degree and may contain mistakes as my scripting skills were just at beginner level.

In this Git repository, the files used and figures produced for the Advanced Research Project in Metagenomics for BIOC0023 course at UCL (3rd-year module) are stored.

## Repository Structure

- Code for this project is available as `.ipynb` file (`Andrej_QIIME2_PE_ENA.ipynb`)
- The code for R, along with all the generated data and figures produced for this paper, is in: `Code_Files_Figures`

## Project Information

- QIIME2 pipeline for clustering and data processing
- Visualization in R Studio code

### Project Summary

This study investigated gut microbiome differences between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and control subjects, as well as changes over time. Significant differences were found in gut microbiome composition between PD and control groups, supporting the existence of a correlation between Parkinson's and certain microbiome changes. No significant differences were observed between the original samples and samples taken two years later, suggesting that microbiome changes could be slow or initiated by a single triggering event. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies, alternative approaches like animal models, and refining study designs to better understand the relationship between the gut microbiome and PD.

### Workflow

1. Collection of fecal samples from PD patients and control subjects at two time points, baseline and 2 years later.
2. DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze gut microbiome composition.
3. Comparison of alpha and beta diversity, using Jaccard distance and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, to assess differences between PD and control groups.
4. Analysis of phyla abundance, including the twelve most abundant phyla, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia.
5. Examination of potential links between gut microbiome changes and Parkinson's disease, with suggestions for future research directions.
